# Experiments_with_Neon_Framework

## Exercise 1
MNIST is a computer vision dataset consisting of 70,000 images of handwritten digits. Each image has 28x28 pixels for a total of 784 features, and is associated with a digit between 0-9. In this exercise, we constructed a multi-layer perceptron to recognize each image.

## Setup

To run this code environment needs to have the following packages installed:
1. neon v2.0.0
2. matplotlib 
3. Python 3.x
